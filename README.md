**Game Feel Adjustments**

- Increased player movement speed to make it easier to catch up to enemies

- Increased rotation on player horizontal movement to make it look a little more dramatic

- Increased health of Enemy 0(It only moves straight, so maybe has heavier armor)

- Reduced health of Enemy 1(because it feels like its side-to-side movement should come at the cost of a little health)

- Reduced health of Enemy 3(It's only ever on screen for a second or two, so the player doesn't have a chance to destroy it often)

- Varied health of Enemy 4's destructible parts

- Adjusted enemy spawn frequencies slightly
